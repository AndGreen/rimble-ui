# **When should toasts be used?**

> For non-critical messages and actions that should be helpful but ultimately ignorable without any impact on what the user wants to get done.

Toast messages are small alerts that provide updates about a process. Use toast messages for non-critical information about whatâ€™s happening within your dApp. They shouldn't be used to notify the user that they ***need*** to do something. For that [see Modals](#).

## General usage guidelines

- **Not for critical information or actions.** By critical, we mean information that will directly impact the success of the user in completing their task, for example a network failure. They dismiss automatically so things can be missed easily. Note: users are able to dismiss them immediately manually.
- **Stick to one action.** This action should support your update and must be optional. This might be to provide further information (like linking to Etherscan) or something that can affect the process (like cancelling while your payment is in a processing state). Action copy should ideally be verb-led like "Cancel", "View", "Buy" or "Change".
- **Think about placement.** Toasts should steer clear of navigational elements and important areas of the screen. Consider that the MetaMask browser extension opens and covers the right of your screen, potentially hiding your toast messages.

## How they work

- They dismiss automatically
- User are able to dismiss them manually
- They display one at a time, so if multiple messages are necessary, each one should appear after the previous message.

**

**Generic message:** should clearly state the update in human terms, referencing the process if possible. NOTE: you very rarely need to use words like "Successfully", the state should speak for itself.

**Action:** should relate to what you're communicating and is optional. If the message is a reversible action, "undo" is often a good choice. If no action is required or relevant, leave it out.

**Example scenarios:**

- A transaction was sent successfully
- A transaction has started
- You're now logged in to your wallet

## Title and subtext (+ optional icon)

*For when you want to provide more value through extra helpful information. Ask yourself when implementing your toast: is there anything else I could tell the user that would be useful?*
